variable names for tei_data_raw.csv 

no_id = individual id
gen_id	- generation (F0, F1, and F2)
vial_id	= number id
genvial_id	= I reused vial_id numbers, so use genvial_id if including effects of vial
diet_group = diet treatment group, categorized by an individual's diet (R, S, or P, 
	representing rich, standard, or poor diet, respectively) and diet of previous
	generations (e.g., F0=R, F1=RP, F2=RPP; F0 had rich food, F1 had poor food, F2 had 
	poor food. The rightmost letter always represents the diet of that generation, and
	each preceding letter represents the diet of the previous generation.
lineage	= indicates which grandparent they had (R, S, or P)
F2_diet	= diet of F2
F1_diet	= diet of F1
F0_diet = diet of F0	
sex	= sex
mass_mg	= mass (in mg)
dev_L1-LP = larval development period = development period (in days) from L1 to LP
dev_LP-A = pupal development period = development period (in days) from LP to adult
dev_L1-A = larval and pupal development period = development time (in days) from L1 to adult
ovar_no	= ovariole number
