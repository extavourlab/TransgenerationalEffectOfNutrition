## Data visualization

This is an interactive data visualization that allows the user to explore interactively the dataset published in the paper **ADD REF TO PAPER ONCE PUBLISHED**.
Represented on the left matrix are the results of corrected pairwise statistical comparisons (Dunn's test) between two sets of generations, each having been subjected to a different diet.
To explore this dataset, you can observe on the matrix the significance of a change of diet in a given phenotype. On the right size, you will find different filters and selectors change the phenotype, or ask particular hypothesis.
For example, you can choose to observe the difference for a Rich F0 diet, followed by a Poor F1 diet, by selecting **Generation Selector: F0 Rich F1 Poor F2 Any**.
To observe the raw data behind a particular comnparison, click on the corresponding square in the matrix, and the raw data will be displayed under *Raw data vizualisation for a given comparison*.
